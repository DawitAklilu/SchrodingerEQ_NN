# SchrodingerEQ_NN

# Question
*Can a neural network fit the time-independent shr√∂dinger equation better than numerical solvers?

# Usage
*Create NN algorithim with the assistance of Jax library to also simulate random generated numbers 

# Results
* Numerical solvers work the best for smaller systems but for much bigger systems and iterations, machine learning would perform the best
